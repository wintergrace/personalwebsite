    <div class = "reveal-scroll"><p class = "description"> My passion for learning was ignited at a very young age. Through homeschooling, I was able to enroll in community college at the age of 11. I learned calculus and fell in love with the sciences. My curiosity for the world carried me through to earning my Bachelor's at age 16. Post graduation, I've immersed myself in a new world: computer science. I love both the creative and optimization sides of coding, and the moment where everything comes together. I'm excited to pursue my career in this field. <br> When I'm not working, you'll find me reading, playing the viola, or playing video games with my friends. I'm an extrovert and generally spend as much time as I can with my people. <br> I think everyone has something unique to bring to the world, and I strongly affirm the unbelievable difference a single person can make. I want to work with a team of individuals who are motivated to solve problems and have fun along the way.<p></div></div>
